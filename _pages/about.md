I'm  an Associate Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the `National School of Applied Sciences in Tetouan`, within the Department of Artificial Intelligence and Digitalization. Before joining the National School of Applied Sciences, I held the position of Full Professor at `Euromed University` in the School of Artificial Intelligence.

## Research

My current research focuses on two main areas:

1. **Time Series Segmentation:** I try explore to innovative techniques for analyzing and segmenting time series data, which is crucial for various applications such as predictive maintenance, financial forecasting, and healthcare monitoring.

2. **Reinforcement Learning:** In the realm of reinforcement learning, I'm  dedicated to addressing several open problems, including:
   - **Exploration vs. Exploitation Dilemma:** Developing algorithms that can effectively balance exploration and exploitation to improve learning efficiency.
   - **Scalability:** Enhancing the scalability of reinforcement learning methods to handle large-scale, real-world environments.
   - **Safety and Robustness:** Ensuring that reinforcement learning systems can operate safely and reliably in dynamic and uncertain settings.
   - **Multi-Agent Systems:** Advancing the understanding and implementation of reinforcement learning in environments with multiple interacting agents, aiming to foster cooperation and competition.

## Projects

I'm searching for enthusiastic PhD students who are eager to take on the challenge and adventure of tackling hard machine learning problems. If you're interested, please visit the page of available [projects](/projects/) or send me a **research proposal**.
