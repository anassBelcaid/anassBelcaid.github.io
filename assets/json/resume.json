The former tries to detect the change points one by one with a sliding window and leads to a lower computational time but are more sensitive to noise. Conversely, offline methods consider the entire data to detect all the change points which make them more robust against the noise but at a price of higher computational cost.

It can be defined as the measure of chaos or disorder in a system[1]. Higher entropy means lower chaos. It is slightly different in information theory. The mathematician Claude Shannon introduced the entropy in information theory in 1948. Entropy in information theory can be defined as the expected number of bits of information contained in an event. For instance, tossing a fair coin has the entropy of 1. It is because of the probability of having a head or tail is 0.5. The amount of information required to identify it’s head or tail is one by asking one, yes or no question — “is it head ? or is it tail?”. If the entropy is higher, that means we need more information to represent an event. Now, we can say that entropy increases with increases in uncertainty. Another example is that crossing the street has less number of information required to represent/ store/ communicate than playing a poker game.
